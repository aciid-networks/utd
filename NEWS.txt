syncpath - Change log:

* version 0.4:
	- Added the option "-s" to skip symbolic links (in Linux).
	- Added the option "-L" to append log files (whereas "-l" overwrites an existing log).
	- Created the Subversion (SVN) repository at sourceforge.
	- Makefile fixed to enable C++ compiler options (-Wall, ...)

* version 0.3:
	- The access time of files is not checked after copying it to a target file to avoid errors in old FAT32 filesystems where this
	   data is not maintained.
	- Statistics at the end of the program now show the number of new, updated, and deleted files.
	
* version 0.2:
	- Now all the file/directory copy operations are performed directly from native C code, avoiding non-portable system calls.
	- The attributes of files (read-only, system, hidden,etc...) are now also maintained (Windows only).
	- Bug fixed for Linux when directories/files contain the special character "$".

* version 0.1:
	- Initial release.
